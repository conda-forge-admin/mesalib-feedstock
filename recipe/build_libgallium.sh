# Every gallium driver named here is compiled into libgallium-${PKG_VERSION}.so,
# which this package ships.  The per-driver packages (mesa-iris, mesa-zink, ...)
# add nothing but the lib/dri symlink that registers one of them with the DRI
# loader, so this list is what decides which of those packages can exist.
#
# Kept off the list on purpose:
#   radeonsi / radv  need libdrm >= 2.4.133; conda-forge is on 2.4.129.
#   nouveau vulkan   (NVK) needs cbindgen, which conda-forge does not package.
#   softpipe         has no lib/dri name of its own -- it shares "swrast" with
#                    llvmpipe and is only reachable via GALLIUM_DRIVER, so it
#                    could not be installed independently anyway.

# d3d12 needs DirectX-Headers, and meson always builds it from the vendored
# subproject: conda-forge's directx-headers is a noarch package that unpacks
# into Library/ (the Windows layout) and ships no pkg-config file, so
# dependency('directx-headers') cannot succeed on any platform and listing it
# as a host requirement does nothing.  The subproject then installs its headers
# and static libs into $PREFIX, where they belong to directx-headers and not to
# us.  Mesa links what it needs statically, so drop the installed copies.
